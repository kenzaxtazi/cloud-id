## Material for meeting 10/12/18

### Tom 
* Downloaded additional data from SLSTR/CALIPSO pairings. 
** Accidentally filled /vols/lhcb/, now deleting a month for each new month downloaded

* Currently have ~ 2,000,000 pixels from 2018

* Adapted code to work with SLSTR/CATS pairings.
CATS ran until late October 2017, so there should be more than a year of overlap with SLSTR data. 	
CATS is on a 5km grid, need to decide how to adapt code from the 1km CALIPSO version.
Collocation has the full range of longitudes for latitudes between -50 and +50. 



** Have 8729 pixels from August 2017 compared to a typical CALIPSO run with the same timewindow of > 100,000
* Currently using Feature_Classification_Flags and Skycondition as truth flags. FCF has 10 measurements per reading, documentation is unclear what the numbers mean.


* Did some simple analysis on the existing 2,000,000 pixels. PCC has been measured at ~ 0.12 when excluding high time difference pixel pairs.

* Looked into the corellation btw bayes masks and CALIOP data

### Kenza 

Things Kenza did this week:
* Added ancillary data to the network ('satellite_zenith_angle', 'solar_zenith_angle', 'latitude_an', 'longitude_an', 'Feature_Classification_Flags') 

* Run the code on whole images, slicing to look at accuracy as a function of time difference. The images below are only 0 to 200s.

* Investigated the upward slope in for the precision vs recall curve
  - Created by lack of data
  - Increased the validation set to 15% of the data

* Investigate the difference between different CALIOP files (see https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/products/CALIPSO_DPC_Rev4x20.pdf)
  - Level 3 products contain monthly-averaged parameters that are mapped onto a uniform spatial grid.
  - Level 4 products contain model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple     measurements.
  - The highest quality data products generated by the DMS are referred to as Standard data products. These products have a 2-4 day latency to incorporate the global meteorological and other reference products.
  - Expedited data product have a shorter production latency because they use the latest meteorological and calibration parameters available at the time of data production. Not recommended as a basis for research findings. 
  
* Found a header in the CALIOP and CATS data theat gives the surface type following the International Feosphere Programme Surface Type Map. 
  - 17 different surface types 
  - 1°x 1° resolution
  - Doesn't represent sea ice (-> limited use for CALIOP data) 
  
 
 ### Over the holidays:
 * add before/after data to model
 * add surface type data
