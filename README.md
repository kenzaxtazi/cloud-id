*DataLoader.py* :


*DataPreparation.py*: functions to prepare data before putting it into the neural network.


*FileDownloader.py*:  


*FullProcess.py*:  


*HEPffn.py*: script creating and running a feed forward neural network (FFN) adapted to run directly on the HEP server.


*ModelApplication.py*: functions to apply model to test SLSTR data.
