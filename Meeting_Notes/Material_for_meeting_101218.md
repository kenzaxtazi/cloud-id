## Material for meeting 10/12/18

### Tom 

### Kenza 

Things Kenza did this week:
* Added ancillary data to the network ('satellite_zenith_angle', 'solar_zenith_angle', 'latitude_an', 'longitude_an', 'Feature_Classification_Flags') 

* Run the code on whole images 

* Investigated the upward slope in for the precision vs recall curve
  - Created by lack of data
  - Increased the validation set to 15% of the data

* Investigate the difference between different CALIOP files (see https://www-calipso.larc.nasa.gov/products/CALIPSO_DPC_Rev4x20.pdf)
  - Level 3 products contain monthly-averaged parameters that are mapped onto a uniform spatial grid.
  - Level 4 products contain model output or results from analyses of lower level data, e.g., variables derived from multiple     measurements.
  - The highest quality data products generated by the DMS are referred to as Standard data products. These products have a 2-4 day latency to incorporate the global meteorological and other reference products.
  - Expedited data product have a shorter production latency because they use the latest meteorological and calibration parameters available at the time of data production. Not recommended as a basis for research findings. 
  
* Found a header in the CALIOP and CATS data theat gives the surface type following the International Feosphere Programme Surface Type Map. 
  - 17 different surface types 
  - 1°lat x 1°long resolution
  - Doesn't represent sea ice (limited use for CALIOP data) 
  
* Looked into the corellation btw bayes masks and the model output 

* Used slicing to look at accuracy as a function of time difference
