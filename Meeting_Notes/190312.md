# Meeting notes

## 12th March 2019

### List of actions completed

- Plotted the ROC curve of the most 'sensistive' channel to the model after shuffling
- Changed all the previous graph to plot AUC instead of accuracy.
- Plotted the accuracy as a function of time for the low broken cumulus (there was not enough data to evaluate the AUC)
