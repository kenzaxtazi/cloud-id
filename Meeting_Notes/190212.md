# Meeting Notes
## 12th February 2019

List of actions completed:
- we have the CNN as part of our super model now, however accuracy is vey poor (approx. 50%)
- the stars are padded with 0. 
- added the copyright notices to our READ ME and files
- strealined the data preparation by creating a class
- trained our current FFN for longer (approx. 4 hours) to reach an accuracy of 88% vs 86%, the network has however not yet converged
- looked into whether we could run the train the model as a function of convergence rather than as function of the number of data points its feeding in. This functionality is not yet available with TFLearn 
- made the surface types exclusive. The model converges faster with this modefication.

For next week or later: 
- implement a new star shape 
- polar map with averages before we submit our RI poster
