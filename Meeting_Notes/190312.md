# Meeting notes

## 12th March 2019

### List of actions completed

- Plotted the ROC curve of the most 'sensitive' channel to the model after shuffling, currently working on data planing.
- Changed all the previous graphs to plot AUC instead of accuracy.
- Plotted the accuracy as a function of time for the low broken cumulus (there was not enough data to evaluate the AUC)
- Remade the number of data vs surface type (correct now, see 190305.md).
- Genralised analysis functions for CNN and SuperModel.
- Downloaded Bayesian model confidences, less than 50% of the data points have this pararemter (approx. 900 000 data points); the confidences are not uniformly distributed.
