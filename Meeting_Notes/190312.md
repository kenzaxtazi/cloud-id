# Meeting notes

## 12th March 2019

### List of actions completed

- Plotted the ROC curve of the most 'sensitive' channel to the model after shuffling, currently working on data planing (see below).
- Put together model comparison email from Barney and Dan's data.
- Tried plotting ROC curves as a function  of cloud type, the function we are using does not have enough data in each category (false positive, false negative, true positive, true negative) to do this.
- Changed all the previous graphs to plot AUC instead of accuracy.
- Plotted the accuracy as a function of time for the low broken cumulus (there was not enough data to evaluate the AUC)
- Remade the number of data vs surface type (correct now, see 190305.md).
- Genralised analysis functions for CNN and SuperModel.
- Downloaded Bayesian model confidences, less than 50% of the data points have this pararemter (approx. 900 000 data points); the confidences are not uniformly distributed. We are currently having difficulty generating ROC curves for these.

### Issue identified with collocation missing some values

![Collocation](http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~trz15/PoorCollocation.png)
![TheoreticalCollocation](http://www.hep.ph.ic.ac.uk/~trz15/NPoleCollocate.png)]
Seems to be a combination of:

- Irregular latitude / longitude gridding of SLSTR data
- Irregular CALIOP gridding
- Cosine approximation to the longitudinal distance

Can be fixed:

- All of the currently collected data is unaffected, i.e. they remain valid matches
- Would result in roughly between 10% - 30% more data

### Examples of how time difference affects the CALIOP truth

### Planing

- Could not find tflearn support for weighted inputs
- Can achieve weighting by using a custom layer with custom  weights between the input layer and the first original layer
